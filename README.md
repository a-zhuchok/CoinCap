# CoinCap

An application for tracking cryptocurrencies and building your own portfolio. The main page displays a list (table) of cryptocurrencies with basic information on them and with controls for adding to the portfolio. When you click on a table element, a page opens with detailed information on the currency, with a control for adding to the portfolio, as well as its history in the form of a graph. When you click on “+”, a modal window opens where you can enter the amount of cryptocurrency and add it to the portfolio in the specified amount. When you click on the portfolio, a modal window opens with a list of currencies in the portfolio and the ability to remove each of them from the portfolio.
